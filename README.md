## Predictive Modeling

### [Quantitative Marketing Analysis](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Quantitative-Marketing-Analysis)
Implemented data analytics best practices to drive valuable insights from operational data to drive best business strategies. 

### [Fraud Detection using Online Customer Transaction ](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Fraud-Detection-From-Customer-Transaction)
Used scikit-learn library in Python to build fraud detection model on highly unbalanced class data of 1GB. Implement calsssical as well as ensembled methods and thoroughly measured different metric of performance. This study can help companies be more vigilant as they can set different parameter based on the companies requirement.

### [Cancer Classification using Gene Expresession Database](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Cancer-Classification-using-Gene-Expression--SVM-and-NaiveBayes-)
Implemented support vector machine and naive bayes algorithm to predict the class for type of cancer based on gene expression database collected by Golub et al "Molecular Classification of Cancer: Class Discovery and Class Prediction by Gene Expression Monitoring". To improve the computation time PCA for dimension reduction has been used and to improve the accuracy hypterparameter tuining was done. Results showed that liner kernel in SVM works best with 100% accurate results.

### [Fake Article Classification Model](https://github.com/zigzagktz/My-work/tree/master/Fake%20Article%20Classification%20Model)
Wrote a Machine Learning algorithm that trains on more than 1000 articles that are stored in seperate folder. The documents were extracted using web scrapping and are stored in .jason format. This model was able to classify fake articles with 78% accuracy which has the possibility for further improvement. Moreover, as future scope the algorithm has be made scalable so that it can classify hundreds or thousands of articles on the web.

### [Sales and score Prediction for IMDb Movies](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Predictive-Modeling-for-IMDb-Movies)
As a project of data mining class, me and my two other group-mates decided to explore the IMDB Movie data set with a problem statement that goes like this---- "How do people determine a successful movie as successful". In other words, it is important to undertsand if a movie with higher IMDb rating is successful, or a movie with higher gross sales is successful. With that aim in mind, we Implementing data clearning, visulization, text-mining and classification, we have predicted both IMDB rating and sales based on different parameters and juxtaposing results using different algorithms.

## Unsupervised Learning 

### [Utility Optimization Model For City of Boston](https://github.com/zigzagktz/My-work/tree/master/Boston%20Utility%20Optimization%20Model)
Utilising the object-oriented concepts of Python programming language I have written down a python script that works as a package for data analysis of Boston utility dataset. The functions written in python script are called in juypter-notebook and then those function gives output that are explained in detail within the same notebook. The notebook is sufficient enough to undertsand the workflow and approach I have taken in order to bring out insights that can help government officials or GIS aspirants to take on from here and advance their own analysis. 

### [Hierarchical Clustering](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Profile/blob/master/Hierarchical%20Clustering%20on%20TripAdvisor%20Review%20Data/clustering.pdf) 
Using the tripadvisor review data I have done agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis. After bulding clusters I have brought some interesting facts that are explained with details in the pdf file.


## Text Analysis
### [Sentiment Analysis on Bhavad Gita](https://github.com/zigzagktz/My-work/tree/master/Bhagvad%20Gita%20Text-Analysis)
Implementing sentiment analysis and other text-mining techniques on one of the biggest religious scripture of Hindu mythology. The pdf file present in the folder and graphs shown are pretty explanatory itself. A lot of refinement and objective clearance is required for this project and I am considering it for future work.

1- Most of the words are positive, which proofs that it is a very uplifting scripture in comparison with other murderous mystery books that would have many negative words.  
2- Also, the negative words that I have represented, most of them must be used with conjunction with positive implications. For example, "placed in heaven after death" here death is a negative word but have positive implication. One can use technique called "n-gram" for that to make meaningful insights.  
3- The use of word "lord" is constantly declining from which I am hypothesizing that maybe early in the book Krishna is addressed as "Lord  or Lord Krishna" but towards the end it would have been just "Krishna"

### [Built Algorithm that can Generating TF-IDF Matrix of Documents](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Profile/blob/master/Building%20TF-IDF%20matrix%20function%20from%20scratch/Code.R)
Developed logical functions using R programming language that calculates term frequency and inverse document frequency for the text documents passed on to those functions. TF-IDF matrix is one of the most crucial aspect while dealing with text-analysis because it helps weed out any unneccasory texts, gives weightage to important words and provides a dataframe with significanly less number of dimensions with comparision with original matrix, and all that while providing us with enrich information.  
 

## Other Independent Work
### [Creating Naive Bayes Algorithm from scratch](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Naive-Bayes-From-Scratch/blob/master/review.R)
Building Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch to classify negative and positive reviews. The text will be broken in corpus and then using Bayse' theorem code will calculate conditional probability for each attribute and decide wheather the reviews is negative or positive.   

### [Audit Analysis of FDA Regulated Industries](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Analysis-of-FDA-Regulated-Industry-Audits/blob/master/The%20full%20detailed%20report.pdf)
The data was collected in order to catch the fradulent firms within USA and outside of USA. I have done deep analysis and have shown results using visulization in order to make it understandable to general audience. This analysis itself is not trageted towards any perticular firm but just bringing insights on the basis of which appropriate authorities can take action.

 
## Statistics
### [Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Profile/tree/master/Hypothesis%20Testings) 
I have done showed practical implimentation of differen kind of hypothesis testing on different kind of data and scenario. There are three folder, each folder has a report describing all my findings and observation. It would be quite undertsnable and easy if the reader directly go through the report of each kind of test I have done. 

### [Principal Component Analysis](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Profile/tree/master/Principal%20Component%20Analysis)
Implementing PCA on building's dataste and reducing it's dimensionility. One can get a very good picture of how PCA works because I have given a detailed description from scratch using 3D represenation. Code in R is also available. The data is also available in folder if one want to implement the code themselves.

### [Lasso Regression](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Profile/tree/master/Lasso%20Regression)
A detailed description of how lasso regression penalize those varibles that are adding noise to the model and only select valuable varibales to protect the model from over fitting. Here I have implemented lasso on diabetes dataset that has very high dimensionility. For more detailed introductory version, I have also written a blog.
