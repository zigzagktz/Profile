## [Academic Project](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Predictive-Modeling-for-IMDb-Movies)
As a project of data mining class, our me and my two other group-mates decided to explore the problem of how do people determine the success of movies. It can be in terms of high IMDb rating or in terms of high sales as well. Implementing data clearning, visulization, text-mining and classification, we have predicted both IMDB rating and sales along with comparision of results from different algorithme.

## [Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Profile/tree/master/Hypothesis%20Testings) 
I have done showed practical implimentation of differen kind of hypothesis testing on different kind of data and scenario. There are three folder, each folder has a report describing all my findings and observation. It would be quite undertsnable and easy if the reader directly go through the report of each kind of test I have done. 

## [Principal Component Analysis](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Profile/tree/master/Principal%20Component%20Analysis)
Implementing PCA on building's dataste and reducing it's dimensionility. One can get a very good picture of how PCA works because I have given a detailed description from scratch using 3D represenation. Code in R is also available. The data is also available in folder if one want to implement the code themselves.

## [Lasso Regression](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Profile/tree/master/Lasso%20Regression)
A detailed description of how lasso regression penalize those varibles that are adding noise to the model and only select valuable varibales to protect the model from over fitting. Here I have implemented lasso on diabetes dataset that has very high dimensionility. For more detailed introductory version, I have also written a blog. 

## [Audit Analysis of FDA Regulated Industries](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Analysis-of-FDA-Regulated-Industry-Audits/blob/master/The%20full%20detailed%20report.pdf)
The data was collected in order to catch the fradulent firms within USA and outside of USA. I have done deep analysis and have shown results using visulization in order to make it understandable to general audience. This analysis itself is not trageted towards any perticular firm but just bringing insights on the basis of which appropriate authorities can take action. 

## [Creating Naive Bayes Algorithm from scratch](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Naive-Bayes-From-Scratch/blob/master/review.R)
Building Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch to build a classification model for negative and positive reviews. The text will be broken in corpus and then using Bayse' theorem code will calculate conditional probability for each attribute and decide wheather the reviews is negative or positive.
