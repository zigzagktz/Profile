## Hypothesis Testing
I have done showed practical implimentation of differen kind of hypothesis testing on different kind of data and scenario. There are three folder, each folder has a report describing all my findings and observation. It would be quite undertsnable and easy if the reader directly go through the report of each kind of test I have done. 

## Principal Component Analysis
Implementing PCA on building's dataste and reducing it's dimensionility. One can get a very good picture of how PCA works because I have given a detailed description from scratch using 3D represenation. Code in R is also available. The data is also available in folder if one want to implement the code themselves.

## Lasso Regression
A detailed description of how lasso regression penalize those varibles that are adding noise to the model and only select valuable varibales to protect the model from over fitting. Here I have implemented lasso on diabetes dataset that has very high dimensionility. For more detailed introductory version, I have also written a blog.
