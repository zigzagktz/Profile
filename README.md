## Academic Project
### [Sales and score Prediction for IMDb Movies](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Predictive-Modeling-for-IMDb-Movies)
As a project of data mining class, our me and my two other group-mates decided to explore the problem of how do people determine the success of movies. It can be in terms of high IMDb rating or in terms of high sales as well. Implementing data clearning, visulization, text-mining and classification, we have predicted both IMDB rating and sales along with comparision of results from different algorithme.

## Text Analysis
### [Sentiment Analysis on Bhavad Gita](https://github.com/zigzagktz/My-work/tree/master/Bhagvad%20Gita%20Text-Analysis)
Implementing sentiment analysis and other text-mining techniques on one of the biggest religious scripture of Hindu mythology. The pdf file present in the folder and graphs shown are pretty explanatory itself. A lot of refinement and objective clearance is required for this project and I am considering it for future work.

1- Most of the words are positive, which proofs that it is a very uplifting scripture in comparison with other murderous mystery books that would have many negative words.  
2- Also, the negative words that I have represented, most of them must be used with conjunction with positive implications. For example, "placed in heaven after death" here death is a negative word but have positive implication. One can use technique called "n-gram" for that to make meaningful insights.  
3- The use of word "lord" is constantly declining from which I am hypothesizing that maybe early in the book Krishna is addressed as "Lord  or Lord Krishna" but towards the end it would have been just "Krishna"

## Statistics
### [Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Profile/tree/master/Hypothesis%20Testings) 
I have done showed practical implimentation of differen kind of hypothesis testing on different kind of data and scenario. There are three folder, each folder has a report describing all my findings and observation. It would be quite undertsnable and easy if the reader directly go through the report of each kind of test I have done. 

### [Principal Component Analysis](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Profile/tree/master/Principal%20Component%20Analysis)
Implementing PCA on building's dataste and reducing it's dimensionility. One can get a very good picture of how PCA works because I have given a detailed description from scratch using 3D represenation. Code in R is also available. The data is also available in folder if one want to implement the code themselves.

### [Lasso Regression](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Profile/tree/master/Lasso%20Regression)
A detailed description of how lasso regression penalize those varibles that are adding noise to the model and only select valuable varibales to protect the model from over fitting. Here I have implemented lasso on diabetes dataset that has very high dimensionility. For more detailed introductory version, I have also written a blog. 

## Independent Work
### [Creating Naive Bayes Algorithm from scratch](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Naive-Bayes-From-Scratch/blob/master/review.R)
Building Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch to classify negative and positive reviews. The text will be broken in corpus and then using Bayse' theorem code will calculate conditional probability for each attribute and decide wheather the reviews is negative or positive.   

### [Creating TF-IDF matrix function from scratch](https://github.com/zigzagktz/My-work/tree/master/Creating%20TF-IDF%20matrix%20function%20from%20scratch)
I have created the logic to implement mathmatical computation that goes behind TF-IDF matrix formation. When we start working on text analysis project, we would need to do some preprocessing. TF-IDF matrix conversion from the corpus of words is also the part of preprocessing.

### [Audit Analysis of FDA Regulated Industries](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Analysis-of-FDA-Regulated-Industry-Audits/blob/master/The%20full%20detailed%20report.pdf)
The data was collected in order to catch the fradulent firms within USA and outside of USA. I have done deep analysis and have shown results using visulization in order to make it understandable to general audience. This analysis itself is not trageted towards any perticular firm but just bringing insights on the basis of which appropriate authorities can take action.

## Unsupervised Learning 
### [Hierarchical Clustering](https://github.com/zigzagktz/Profile/blob/master/Hierarchical%20Clustering%20on%20TripAdvisor%20Review%20Data/clustering.pdf) 
Using the tripadvisor review data I have done agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis. After bulding clusters I have brought some interesting facts that are explained with details in the pdf file.
